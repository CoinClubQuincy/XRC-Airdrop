This contract allows token creators to log and airdrop their token to new holders

In the crypto space it is becoming increasingly popular to airdrop tokens for new projects being created. This is done for a collection of reasons, some focus on decentralization and try to widend the maximum reach of possible holders, others want to reward early supporters of the project and continually issue rewards to projects, or maybe some shareholders who listed their stock on the blockchain just want a simple automated way to issue their token to the correct holders.


The general Idea of this contract is to allow for new projects & DAOs can add a redeem button to their website and mobile apps as a native means of distribution of their tokens currently there are a handful of third party applications Offer to assist developers airdrop their tokens but with this contract simply launching the contract alongside the main project and loading it with the appropriate amount to airdrop and developers on the XDC network can have an easy means of delivering their asses to their users 

I built this new Airdrop contract to help Developers on the XDC network Drop their newly minted project tokens to their users with a few simple steps.
