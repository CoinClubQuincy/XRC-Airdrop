How to airdrop tokens on the XDC Network XRC-AirDrop 
- #BuildItOnXDC

In the crypto space, it is becoming increasingly popular to airdrop tokens for new projects. This is done for a collection of reasons. Some focus on decentralization and widening the maximum distribution of holders. Others want to reward early supporters of the project and continually issue rewards to holders. Sometimes shareholders who listed their stock on the blockchain simply want an easy automated way to issue their token to the correct holders. Whatever the reasoning, airdropping allows for newly created assets to be issued to many parties without a need for a custodian for issuance.

I recently built a new AirDrop contract to give creators of new tokens as well as DAOs the ability to add a “redeem” button to their website and mobile applications as a native means to distribute tokens. While a handful of third-party apps offer to assist developers in airdropping their tokens, this code, native to the XDC Network, does so more simply. Users (simply) launch  this contract alongside their project before loading the appropriate amount to airdrop. It’s an easy way to deliver assets to digital wallets. Here are the steps:


Launch Token
Launch Airdrop Contract
Load UserData into airdrop 
Deploy Airdrop
Users Redeem Airdrop
